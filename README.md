Computer vs User Numbers Guessing Game

This repository will hold the file for the Computer/User Numbers game.

The main.py file, will hold the code required for the user to run the game. 

This program will prompt a player to pick a number between 1 and 15 and will give them 5 guesses.
It will print out if the players guess was too high or too low compared to the randomized number the computer will choose. It will also tell the player how many guesses out of 5 that it took them to guess/ that they have reamining or that they have used. 
Whether the player guesses it or fails to within the 5 allotted guesses, a prompt will show and ask if they would like to guess a number again or exit the program. 

I took parts of both the example guessing game and the Control Structures programs and mixed them together to make the program. 
DISCLAIMER: Some of the lines of code were modeled after Prof. Francis's work and I want to give credit.
